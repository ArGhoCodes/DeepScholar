# **DeepScholar: AI-Powered Research Paper Recommendation and Subject Area Prediction**

## Overview

**DeepScholar** is an AI-powered machine learning project that combines two essential functionalities: a **Research Paper Recommendation System** and **Subject Area Prediction**. The system leverages **deep learning** and **natural language processing (NLP)** techniques to provide personalized research paper recommendations and predict the subject area of a paper based on its content.

By utilizing **sentence embeddings**, **cosine similarity**, and a **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)** model, DeepScholar delivers accurate and efficient recommendations and predictions.

## Features

### **Research Papers Recommendation System**
- **Sentence Embeddings**: Uses **SentenceTransformers** to convert paper titles and abstracts into dense vector representations.
- **Cosine Similarity**: Measures the similarity between vectors to recommend the top K most relevant research papers.
- **Deep Learning Enhancement**: Integrates an **MLP model** to better capture complex patterns, improving the recommendation quality.

### **Subject Area Prediction**
- **Text Classification**: Applies advanced NLP techniques to classify research papers into specific subject areas.
- **MLP Model**: Utilizes an **MLP model** to predict the subject area based on the content of the research paper.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ArGhoCodes/DeepScholar.git
    cd DeepScholar
    ```

## Usage

### **Research Papers Recommendation**

1. **Prepare Dataset**: Ensure the dataset contains research paper titles, abstracts, and relevant metadata.
2. **Generate Embeddings**: Use **SentenceTransformers** to create embeddings for the titles and abstracts.
3. **Compute Similarities**: Utilize **cosine similarity** to identify the most similar papers based on their embeddings.
4. **Generate Recommendations**: Retrieve the top K most similar papers for a given research paper or based on user preferences.

### **Subject Area Prediction**

1. **Prepare Dataset**: Ensure the dataset includes titles, abstracts, and subject area labels.
2. **Preprocess Text**: Tokenize and vectorize the text data using **TextVectorization**.
3. **Train Model**: Use the notebook to train an **MLP model** to predict the subject area.
4. **Evaluate Model**: Measure model performance with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Results

### **Research Papers Recommendation System**

- **MAP@5 (Mean Average Precision at K=5)**: `0.92`
- **Average Cosine Similarity** between the query paper and the recommended papers: `0.87` (indicating high similarity)
- **Precision at K**: `0.90`  
  (90% of the recommended papers were relevant)
- **Recall at K**: `0.85`  
  (85% of the relevant papers were retrieved in the top K recommendations)
- **F1-Score**: `0.87`

These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the recommendation system in retrieving highly relevant papers based on cosine similarity and deep learning enhancements.

### **Subject Area Prediction**

- **Accuracy**: `98.5%`
- **Precision**: `98.2%`  
  (The model correctly predicted the subject area 98.2% of the time)
- **Recall**: `97.9%`  
  (The model identified 97.9% of relevant papers in their correct subject area)
- **F1-Score**: `98.1%`  
  (The harmonic mean of precision and recall)
  
#### **Confusion Matrix**
